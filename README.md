Creating a chess game with elm.

## Run Locally

First, make sure that you have [elm](https://guide.elm-lang.org/install.html) installed.

Next, clone the repo...
```
git clone git@github.com:RobStallion/chess-elm.git
```

Finally, run the following command...
```
elm-live src/Main.elm --open --dir=public -- --output=public/js/elm.js --debug
```

And that's it ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰

## Why

I decided to start building this because I like chess (although, sadly, I am not
very good) and because I really like elm. I thought it would be a good way for
me to sharpen my elm skills while also **HOPEFULLY** gaining a better
understanding of chess.
